 * Due Oct 5, 2017
 * Project 1 reads a .txt file with information to create a database, in which 
 * differentiates names, emails, idnumbers, etc, and puts them into a MyRecord
 * Array to become a record. The user inputs a a number between 0 and the  
 * amount of records, and then displays the contents within the record. As well, 
 * the user can input a record size in which will display the records afterward.
